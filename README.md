# Date Range Picker for Bootstrap based on Dan Grossman's awesome 

This daterangepicker is based on Dan Grossman's [daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker).

# Main changes
1. The daterangepicker will not execute the callback when clicking outside the calendar modal. The original daterangepicker will execute the callback function as if the user clicked 'Apply' button.
2. User can select a date range by first clicking on a date and then choosing a date in the past. The plugin will determine which date should be a start date and set the end date accordingly. The original plugin would reset the selection, forcing the user to select the end.

This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, optional time picker (for e.g. making appointments or reservations),
and styles that match the default Bootstrap 3 theme.
